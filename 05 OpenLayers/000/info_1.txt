The **difference between EPSG:4326 and EPSG:3857** lies in their coordinate systems and how they represent locations on the Earth's surface.

### EPSG:4326 (WGS 84) -> Lan, Lon
- **Type**: Geographic Coordinate System
- **Representation**: Uses latitude and longitude in degrees.
- **Range**: Coordinates are expressed within the range of -180 to 180 for longitude and -90 to 90 for latitude.
- **Surface**: Represents the Earth as a three-dimensional ellipsoid.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in GPS, mapping applications, and data storage, especially for global datasets. It is the default for many GIS applications and standards like GeoJSON[1][2][5].

### EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) - Default!
- **Type**: Projected Coordinate System
- **Representation**: Uses meters as units, resulting in large numerical values that exceed the range of geographic coordinates.
- **Surface**: Projects the Earth's surface onto a two-dimensional plane using a spherical model, which can introduce distortions, particularly at high latitudes.
- **Usage**: Widely used in web mapping services (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) because it allows for efficient tile-based rendering of maps. This projection is optimized for visual representation rather than precise geographic accuracy[2][3][4].

### Key Differences
- **Coordinate Format**:
  - EPSG:4326 uses small decimal numbers (e.g., latitude 48.8589, longitude 2.2944).
  - EPSG:3857 uses large numbers (e.g., x = 6250962.06, y = 253457.62) since it converts geographic coordinates into a flat map representation[1][2].

- **Projection Type**:
  - EPSG:4326 is suitable for applications needing accurate geographic data over large areas without distortion.
  - EPSG:3857 is preferred for web mapping due to its compatibility with tile-based systems but may distort shapes and distances, especially away from the equator[3][4][5].

In summary, EPSG:4326 is ideal for accurate geographic representation, while EPSG:3857 is optimized for web mapping applications where visual presentation is prioritized.
